A recent study examined the impact of sleep patterns on academic performance among college students. The research tracked 500 students over two semesters, monitoring sleep duration, quality, and consistency. Results showed that students maintaining regular sleep schedules (7-9 hours nightly) achieved significantly higher GPAs. Irregular sleep patterns correlated with lower test scores and increased course withdrawal rates. The study controlled for variables including study time, course difficulty, and prior academic performance.
