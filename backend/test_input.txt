Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an innovative educational approach where students learn by actively engaging in real-world projects. Unlike traditional classroom methods, PBL encourages students to investigate and respond to authentic, engaging, and complex questions or challenges. Through this process, students develop deep content knowledge as well as critical thinking, creativity, and communication skills. In PBL, students work on a project over an extended period - from a week up to a semester - that engages them in solving a real-world problem or answering a complex question. They demonstrate their knowledge and skills by creating a public product or presentation for a real audience. As a result, students develop deep content knowledge as well as critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, and communication skills. The benefits of PBL include increased student engagement, better retention of knowledge, development of real-world skills, and improved problem-solving abilities. Research has shown that students in PBL classrooms perform better on standardized tests and demonstrate better long-term retention of content compared to students in traditional classroom settings. Teachers in PBL environments act as facilitators rather than instructors, guiding students through their learning journey while allowing them to make their own discoveries and decisions. This approach helps students become more independent learners and better prepared for college and career challenges.
